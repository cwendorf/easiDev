## Mixed Vignette

This vignette analyzes data from a two-factor mixed design.

```{r}
source("http://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwendorf/easiDev/main/source-easiDev.R")
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
devtools::source_gist("8e6e5dc401e3fc1042ef7a030f9d19c7", filename = "revised_toc.R")
thisfile <- knitr::current_input()
revised_toc(thisfile, base_level = 3, toc_depth = 4)

### Data Management

#### Data Entry

```{r}
Factor <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2)
Outcome1 <- c(0, 0, 3, 5, 1, 3, 6, 6)
Outcome2 <- c(4, 7, 4, 9, 3, 1, 6, 6)
Outcome3 <- c(4, 9, 6, 9, 3, 3, 6, 8)
Factor <- factor(Factor, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Level1", "Level2"))
MixedData <- data.frame(Factor, Outcome1, Outcome2, Outcome3)
MixedData
```

#### Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
descMeansBy(cbind(Outcome1, Outcome2, Outcome3), by = Factor)
```

### Analyses of the Means

#### Confidence Intervals

```{r}
ciMeansBy(cbind(Outcome1, Outcome2, Outcome3), by = Factor)
ciMeansBy(cbind(Outcome1, Outcome2, Outcome3), by = Factor, conf.level = .99)
```

#### Significance Tests

```{r}
nhstMeansBy(cbind(Outcome1, Outcome2, Outcome3), by = Factor)
nhstMeansBy(cbind(Outcome1, Outcome2, Outcome3), by = Factor, mu = 5)
```

### Analyses of the Effects

#### Source Table

```{r}
descMultifactor(cbind(Outcome1, Outcome2, Outcome3), by = Factor)
```

#### Significance Test

```{r}
nhstMultifactor(cbind(Outcome1, Outcome2, Outcome3), by = Factor)
```

#### Effect Size

```{r}
pvaMultifactor(cbind(Outcome1, Outcome2, Outcome3), by = Factor)
```
